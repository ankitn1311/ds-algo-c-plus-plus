## Folder - fourfify

### This folder is for the question of love babar channel.

- In this Readme all the content is related to _fourfify_ folder.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder - apna-college-ques

### This folder is for the question and theory for the apna college youtube channel.

- There is separate Readme file for this named _README2_.

Data Structrues and Algorithms coding starting 23-10-2020

# FILES USAGE

- **file.cpp** -> coding to be done on this file

- **input.txt** -> for input

- **output.txt** -> for output

  - **script.sh** file usage
    `script.sh <argument1> <argument2>`

    **argument1** -> directory_name
    **argument2** -> filename ( .cpp will automatically added )

  EXAMPLE : `bash script.sh codeforces/A file_name`
  This will create a file named file_name.cpp in dircetory codeforces/A.

template.cpp -> content of this file will automatically be added to file.c after running the script.sh command.

### These are the 450 questions from Love Babar youtube channel recommendations so that's why there is a folder named _fourfifty_ and all the questions are there starting **01-a**..**01-b**..**02-c** till maybe **450-a**

- Here a, b, c after 01,02 denotes different implementations of same question.

## 1. Reverse the array.

- a. Normal Approach:
  By swapping of elements of either sides.
- b. Recursive Approach

## 2. MIN and MAX in an array using min. no of comparison

- a. Normal Linear Search.
- b. Using Recursion. (Tournament Method)
- c. Compare in Pairs.

## 3. Kth smallest element.

- a. Novice approach (Sorting)
- b. Min heap approach (HeapSelect)
- c. Max heap approach
- d. QuickSelect
  - Optimization of quick sort algorithm (Pivot till we found kth element)
- e. Randomized QuickSelect
  - Using rand() to generate index between l and r swap the element at randomly generated index with the last element.
- f. Balanced QuickSelect

## 4. Segregate 0's 1's and 2's in an array

- a. Three variable and swap the values accordingly
- b. Two loops : first for incremting count of 3 variables and 2 for filling the array again according to counter.

## 5. Move all negative numbers to beginning

- a. Two Pointer approach.

## 6. Rotate elements of array by one

- a. Store last element in variable and then move all elements by one and add the last element to first position.

## 7. Merge sorted arrays and count elements(UNION).

- a. Using unordered_set.
- b. Using binary_search.

## 8. Contiguous sub-array maximum sum (Kadane's Algorithm)
